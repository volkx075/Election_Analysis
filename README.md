## Purpose
Sam and Tom needs help analyzing the election data. They need the total number of votes, the votes made per candidate and the percentage, and who won the election. After submitting the results, the election commission asked for the voter turnout and percentage per county. Also, which county had the highest turnout. Our goal is to provide Sam and Tom with all the information the election commission is requesting.
