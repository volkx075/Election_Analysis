# Election Analysis
![Election Code](PyPoll_Challenge.py)
## Purpose
Sam and Tom needs our help analyzing the election data. The election commission requested for the total number of votes, the votes made per candidate and the percentage, and who won the election with their vote count and percentage. After submitting the results, the election commission asked for the voter turnout and percentage per county. Also, which county had the highest turnout. Our goal is to provide Sam and Tom with all the information the election commission is requesting.

## Summary
This script can not only be used for the election Sam and Tom were covering, but it can be used for any election with modifications to the code. For example, we could alter the code for a Presidental election. Instead of showing the breakdown for each county, we would show a breakdown for each state. Also, we would add a breakdown of Republican votes vs. Democratic votes for each state and for the entire country. We could do the same for a State Governor election and breaking it down by county, instead of state. Another example, with this script, we could do a U.S. Senate race. Again, we would do a breakdown for each state of how many votes were cast. Also, we would alter the code to output the two winners from each state along with their number of votes and percentage.
